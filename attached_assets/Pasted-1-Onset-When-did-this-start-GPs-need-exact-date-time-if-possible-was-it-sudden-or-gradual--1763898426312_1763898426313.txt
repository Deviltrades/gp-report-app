1. Onset

“When did this start?”
GPs need:

exact date

time if possible

was it sudden or gradual?

Most people say “I think last week?”
Your app removes that confusion.

⭐ 2. Frequency

“How often does this happen?”
GPs want:

once per day?

random?

only at certain times?

only after certain activities?

Your app tracks every entry so they can see patterns.

⭐ 3. Duration

“How long does each episode last?”
They need:

minutes?

hours?

all day?

This helps them figure out what type of condition it might be.

⭐ 4. Severity

“How strong is the pain/symptom?”
They ALWAYS ask for:

mild

moderate

severe
Or a numbered scale (1–10).
Your slider solves this instantly.

⭐ 5. Triggers

“Does anything trigger it?”
Example triggers:

standing

food

caffeine

exercise

stress

twisting

lying down

heat/cold

GPs use triggers to diagnose root cause.

⭐ 6. Relievers

“Does anything make it better?”
Important for diagnosis.

Things like:

rest

water

heat

lying down

stretching

medication

nothing helps

This is powerful info.

⭐ 7. Associated symptoms

“What else happens at the same time?”

Example:

dizziness + nausea

numbness + fatigue

back pain + dark urine

chest pain + anxiety

headaches + tingling

groin ache + flank ache

Patterns are EVERYTHING for a GP.

⭐ 8. Impact on daily life

GPs always ask:

“Are you able to work?”

“Are you sleeping okay?”

“Is it stopping you from doing daily tasks?”

You can add a simple toggle:

Impact Today: none / mild / moderate / severe

⭐ 9. Medication taken

They need to know:

Did you take anything?

Did it help?

How much?

You can keep this optional.

⭐ 10. Timeline clarity

GPs LOVE timelines because they can see:

whether symptoms are worsening

whether the frequency is increasing

whether severity is escalating

whether patterns exist

This is the #1 thing your app does better than 99% of symptom trackers.

⭐ 11. Location

Where EXACTLY is the symptom?

Especially important for:

stomach pain

chest pain

kidney/flank pain

groin/testicle pain

headaches

You can add a small text field:
“Location (e.g., left flank, lower back, upper stomach, right temple)”

⭐ 12. Red flags

GPs look for “red flags” such as:

blood in urine

blood in stool

chest pressure

fainting

fever

sudden severe pain

unexplained weight loss

You can add a toggle:
“Did you have any alert symptoms with this episode?”
(and show a few examples)
